                <p class="paragraph">The Foundation Diploma is ideal for people with little industry experience, but who would like to gain practical knowledge and a sound qualification. It involves taking the Introduction to Shipping paper plus logistics and multi-modal transport.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The Foundation Diploma is a standalone qualification in its own right, but because it can count towards your membership examinations it is also a great way to ease into study and gives you an overall view of the business. The Foundation Diploma is awarded if both subjects are passed in the same exam sitting.</p>
